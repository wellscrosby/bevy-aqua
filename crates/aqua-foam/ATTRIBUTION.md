## Crest Ocean System

Aqua's ocean techniques were developed by studying the [Crest Ocean System](https://github.com/wave-harmonic/crest/tree/db0658ff0b2e93e4a9e28cc2867509658b0ecc00) and reimplementing its approaches for Bevy in Aqua's own Rust and WGSL. Two Crest texture assets are redistributed verbatim. Their source-repository and upstream paths are:

- `crates/aqua-core/assets/WaveNormals.png` from `crest/Assets/Crest/Crest/Textures/WaveNormals/WaveNormals.png` (packaged by `aqua-core` as `assets/WaveNormals.png`).
- `crates/aqua-foam/assets/Foam2.png` from `crest/Assets/Crest/Crest/Textures/Foam2.png` (packaged by `aqua-foam` as `assets/Foam2.png`; GUID `02e417d5711139342884479f53dbecea`, bound to `_FoamTexture` by the shipped `Ocean.mat`).

Aqua's FFT foam reconstruction, close-range sub-surface scattering, and roughness-damped Fresnel model reimplement techniques studied in [GodotOceanWaves](https://github.com/2Retr0/GodotOceanWaves/tree/a171446f8174348895aaafc426576c26261058b9).

## Reference scope

Crest references include `Scripts/OceanBuilder.cs`, `Scripts/LodData/LodTransform.cs`, `Shaders/Ocean.shader`, `Shaders/OceanEmission.hlsl`, `Shaders/OceanFoam.hlsl`, and the shipped `Materials/Ocean.mat`. Aqua's source comments and tests record retained implementation-specific divergences where they matter.

GodotOceanWaves references include `assets/shaders/spatial/water.gdshader` and its FFT spectrum/resolve shaders. Aqua adapts these mechanisms to Bevy's pre-exposed lighting and render graph rather than claiming engine or visual parity.

The screenshots under `docs/images/` are deterministic renders produced by bevy-aqua's examples. The planar-reflection and sunset frames include the local CC0 buoy test model, which is not distributed in the crate package.

## Package license

Aqua packages are distributed under `MIT OR Apache-2.0`; see `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE`. The upstream copyright and permission notices reproduced above travel with every Aqua package.
